			<h2>About Me </h2>
				<section id="firstleft">
				<div>
				<p>My name is Nathaniel Mendoza and this is place holder text to use while I build this webpage. In June i made one of the greatest decisions of my life - I went to Japan. Now, it wasn't all fun and game, although i had plenty of that. My main two tasks were to take classes for international economic conditions, and to do field research on those condtions in Japan. 
				</p></div>

				<p id="p2"> I also spent some time checking out the cultural differences. It was amazing to me, to try and understand a completely different way of life, ideologies, ideals - the best one to explore was the food. The ramen in Japan was, without suprise, far superior than any that i've had in the states. i couldn't believe it. Okay, I believe this is all the text i need for now, but i'll be back!
